### reasons for writing
I want a[ digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden). I want to share my perspective. I want to connect with people who care about the same things. I want a corner of the web that has all the things that I like. I want a space where I am the editor-in-chief. I want to publish the things that I talk about a lot. I want a forcing function to synthesize all the streams I consume. I want a public record of my lessons and learnings to help others (and my future self). I want to be a writer. 

What I'll be writing about (which is always subject to change due to the beautiful and never-ending rabbit holes of my life):
- Building research and design practices and projects in the public interest mostly focused on the healthcare/digital health ecosystem. 
- Emerging bioethical considerations within the health tech and science landscape mostly focused on scientific progress in psychedelic science and women's health.
### reasons for not writing
None. All prior reasons (e.g. don't know enough, don't have time, don't have novel ideas) have been handled by some good ol' positive reframing. If you don't like it here, that's okay.
